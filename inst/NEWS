  plotTimeSeries, plotTurbIEC, profile, turbulence, weibull:
  time stamp issue fixed

* messages/warnings cleaned up
  

bReeze 0.3-1 [2014-03-31]
-------------------------

* availability, frequency, monthStats, plotDay, plotPolar, 
  plotTurbIEC, profile, turbulence, weibull: specify data subsets
  by date

* plotDay: sectoral plotting for single data sets added

* profile: alpha as single value or vector (one per sector)

* several improvements/fixes of code and documentation


bReeze 0.3-0 [2014-01-13]
-------------------------

* plotMap: function for simple map plotting is back, 
  now based on RgoogleMaps package

* uncertainty: new function for uncertainty assessment 

* plotUncertainty: new function for uncertainty plots

* short name wrapper functions: bug fixed - default value 
  confusion


bReeze 0.2-4 [2013-12-04]
-------------------------

* formatTS: removed some test code left in last version

* readPC: simpler specifying of package directory files

* some background improvements/fixes


bReeze 0.2-3 [2013-09-17]
-------------------------

* monthStats: all available signals of the met mast can now be 
  used for calculations;
  in addition to "mean", also "median", "min", "max" and "sd" 
  can be applied

* plotAvailability: faster plotting

* profile: new method loglm (log-linear model) added - now more
  than two heights can be used for profile calculation


bReeze 0.2-2 [2013-06-27]
-------------------------

* availability: v.set and dir.set can now handle vectors of 
  datasets 

* availability, clean, frequency, monthStats, plotAvailability, 
  plotDay, plotMonthStats, plotTimeSeries, plotTurbIEC,profile, 
  turbulence, weibull: data sets can now be specified by name

* formatTS: bug fixed - handling of duplicates

* plotPC: bug fixed - ugly axis if both coefficients are plotted;
  a list of power curves can now be plotted at once

* printObject: bugs fixed - function calls incorrect in some 
  cases

* readPC: power curve data base update

* new short name aliases for functions


bReeze 0.2-1 [2013-02-28]
-------------------------

* energy, frequency and plotProfile: bug fixed - output of 
  internally called function printed

* frequency, profile, turbulence, weibull: number of sectors no
  longer limited to 4/8/12/16

* monthStats: bug fixed - calculation error for met masts 
  with just one dataset

* printObject: bug fixed - original/cleaned data displayed
  wrong for met masts with just one dataset

* polar plotting functions (plotAep, plotEnergy, plotFrequency, 
  plotPolar, plotTurbulence): optional graphical parameters
  added

* some small code and documentation cosmetics


bReeze 0.2-0 [2013-02-06]
-------------------------

* clean: wind direction values are now excluded, where wind 
  speed is lower than the v.avg.min specified; 
  bug fixed - unwanted cleanings and wrong feedback possible; 
  repetitions can now be cleaned

* frequency: bug fixed - wrong frequency
  values possible for uncleaned mast objects

* plotDay: now all signals can be plottet

* plotMap: function removed from package due to disproportional 
  high installation requirements compared to the low performance 
  of the used OpenStreetMap package

* printMast: replaced by printObject

* printObject: new print method for all bReeze objects; 
  bug fixed in old printMast method, that returned wrong 
  availability values

* plotting functions (plotAep, plotAvailability, plotDay, 
  plotEnergy, plotFrequency, plotMonthStats, plotPC, plotPolar, 
  plotProfile, plotTimeSeries, plotTurbIEC, plotTurbulence, 
  plotWbDir, plotWeibull): many optional graphical parameters 
  added

* processing functions (aep, energy, frequency, monthStats, 
  profile, turbulence, weibull): new 'digits' argument for the 
  number of decimal places to be used for results; new 'print' 
  argument to show/hide results

* further small improvements of code and documentation; 
  namespace added


bReeze 0.1-1 [2012-10-21]
-------------------------

* aep: capacity factor added to the output

* availability: two bugs fixed - slightly wrong availability 
  values in some cases of missing samples; error in calculation 
  for sets with just one signal 

* clean: wind speed limit for calculation of turbulence intensity
  can now be adjusted by the user

* createPC: if rated.p is not given, rated power is now
  automatically set to the maximum power value; desc argument for
  name and/or description of a wind turbine added

* formatTS: available patterns cleaned up and internal handling
  enhanced; possible error in pattern selection fixed

* plotTimeSeries: bug fixed - blocking of '00:00:00' time stamps 
  for the start and end arguments


bReeze 0.1-0 [2012-07-10]
-------------------------

* This is the first version
